Extra Addon idea after the game is stable and basics are complete.
    How does the player keep track of the contacts?
    How do you make sure the player has the correct items needed for the contact?
    Is there a penality for not completing the contract within a period time?
    Can the player do jobs for the shop in order to get a better discount on future items?
    Does the prices go up or go down within the shop depending if the player fails the contracts?
    Create a separate file for all functions
    Create a sepearate file for menus to be displayed

Exit:
Good Bye!
